#Stub dictionary
#READ ME
#IMPORTANT: STUB SYNTAX "'FILEPATH'-'STUB'.'FILE TYPE'"
#EX: C:\Users\Derek\Desktop\Test-1234.txt stub=1234
#Pass store a file path and it will get the stub, enter it into the dict and write to the output file
#Pass getPath a stub and it will return the path associated with that stub
#Pass getStub a path and it will return the stub associated with that path
#Pass changePath a stub and a new path and it will update the dictionary
#The dictionary will be written to Dictionary_output.txt

# Changes marked with comment 'v2.0' were made in this revision
