####FLOCK SSG
This is the project for CS 370 (Software Development).
It's a team-based project that spans over the whole semester. It consists in making a static site generator in Python.
Other team members:

 * Derek Connelly
 * Dan Levy
 * Lukas Mallory

**Project Description**
A simple website generation tool in Python should be able to gather information on how the website should look like from the user. This information includes, theme, colors, data/text to display. The user inputs one or more markdown files (file.md) to the website generator. The program then takes these files, indexes them and converts them to working HTML. A folder with the whole website/converted files is then created with the correct hierarchy. The program keeps track of the data gathered from the user to be able to re-open a previously-created project and modify it on a later date.

The project name is **Flock**
