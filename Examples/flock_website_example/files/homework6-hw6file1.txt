    2. Each flight has a unique number, an airline for that flight, and the days for when it is scheduled.
    
    3. Every flight is made up of one or more flight "LEGs".
       Each flight "LEG" has a departure airport with its scheduled departure time and, an arrival airport with its own scheduled arrival time.
    
    4. Each flight "LEG INSTANCE" is an instance of a flight "LEG" on a specific date.
       The actual departure and arrival times for each airport are recorded together with the information of each flight leg after it arrives.
       The database also keeps track of the number of available seats and the aircraft used in each "LEG INSTANCE".
    
    5. The customer reservations for each instance include the customer name, their phone number and their seat number on the plane for each reservation they have stored.
    
    6. The database also keeps track of info about the airplanes, such as the airplane type and model.
       For each airplane type, there's a record for type name, manufacturing company, and max number of seats on the aircraft.
       There also a record list for the airports in which each plane of a specific type can land.
       Every airplane has an airplane ID, the total number of seats and type in the database.
