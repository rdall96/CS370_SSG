PROJECT DESCRIPTION

A simple website generation tool in Python should be able to gather information on how the website should look like from the user.
This information includes, theme, colors, data/text to display. The user inputs one or more markdown files (file.md) to the website generator.
The program then takes these files, indexes them and converts them to working HTML. A folder with the whole website/converted files is then created with the correct hierarchy.
The program keeps track of the data gathered from the user to be able to re-open a previously-created project and modify it on a later date.
