PROJECT DESCRIPTION

A simple website generation tool in Python should be able to gather information on how the website should look like from the user. This information includes, theme, colors, data/text to display. User input is gathered through a list of commands the user will type in command line and later on a nice polished GUI.
The program keeps track of the data gathered from the user in the form of log files (xml ?) to be able to re-open a previously-created project and modify it on a later date.
Finally, the program will take the data contained in the log files and combine it with that of other static files to generate the html and css needed for the website.
